                <h2>My Love,</h2>
                <p>I've been reflecting on the way I've treated you, and I realize I've hurt you in ways you never
                    deserved.
                    I've been unfair, allowing my own frustrations and emotions to cloud my judgment, and in doing so, I
                    blamed you for things that were never your fault. I let my anger take over, when all you've ever
                    done is
                    be there for me, loving me unconditionally. <br><br>

                    I'm truly sorry for every time I raised my voice, for every moment I made you feel small or
                    unimportant,
                    yet I've been doing just that, over and over again. I know I've caused you pain, and I hate myself
                    for
                    it because you deserve so much better. <br><br>

                    I want to be better for you. I want to love you the way you deserve to be loved-patiently, kindly,
                    and
                    without letting my own issues get in the way. I promise to work on myself, to become the partner you
                    need and the person I should be. <br><br>

                    Please know that I am deeply sorry. I love you more than I can express, and I am committed to making
                    things right, to proving that you're the most important part of my life. <br><br>

                    You're not just someone I love, you're the person I see myself growing old with, building a life
                    with,
                    and creating memories that will last a lifetime. <br>

                    Every dream I have for the future includes you. I want to do all the things I've never done before,
                    to
                    face challenges, celebrate victories, and build a life that's full of love and happiness with you.
                    <br><br>
                    I don't want anyone else but you, and I don't want to experience life's biggest moments without you
                    by
                    my side.<br>
                    I'm sorry for all the times I made you feel like you weren't enough, because the truth is, you're
                    more
                    than enough. You are everything to me. <br><br>

                    I know that saying I'll change isn't enoughâ€”I need to show you through my actions. But please
                    believe me
                    when I say that I'm committed to being better, not just for you, but for us. I love you with all my
                    heart, and I want to spend the rest of my life proving that to you.
                    <br><br>


                    With all my love, now and always, <br>
                    Adnan
